# ML4T Live

Run a lifecycle-v1 `Strategy` against real brokers and live market data, with `SafeBroker` risk
controls layered on top.

`ml4t-live` is the deployment layer in the ML4T stack. It sits after research and backtesting, where
the task is to preserve portable strategy decisions while controlling broker and operational risk. The library is built for staged rollout:
shadow mode first, then paper trading, then small live size under explicit limits.

## Start with a completed run

The [Quickstart](getting-started/quickstart.md) runs `LiveEngine` against synthetic bars with
`SafeBroker(execution_mode="shadow")`. It prints strategy prices, virtual positions, and a final
completion line without credentials or venue orders. Then use the
[task guides](user-guide/examples.md), [exact API reference](api/index.md), and
[checked book examples](book-guide/index.md) for your next task.

## What You Can Do With It Right Now

With `ml4t-live`, you can:

- take an existing `ml4t-backtest.Strategy` and run it in `LiveEngine`
- connect that strategy to Alpaca or Interactive Brokers
- replay or stream data through a live-style feed interface
- start in `execution_mode="shadow"` so orders are tracked but not routed
- add hard limits for order size, exposure, stale data, daily loss, and drawdown before going live
- inspect persisted state and broker reachability with `ml4t-live status`
- run bounded shadow sessions from the CLI before promoting to paper or live

If you do not yet have a validated strategy, start in `ml4t-backtest`. If you do have one, this is the
next layer.

## Where It Fits In The ML4T Stack

| Stage | Primary library | Practical question |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Data preparation | `ml4t-data` | Do I trust the raw and canonical inputs? |
| Features and labels | `ml4t-engineer` | Am I computing the right signals? |
| Diagnostics and validation | `ml4t-diagnostic` | Are the signals robust and statistically defensible? |
| Simulation and cost realism | `ml4t-backtest` | Does the strategy survive explicit execution assumptions? |
| Deployment and staged rollout | `ml4t-live` | Can I run the validated strategy against a real broker safely? |

## Strategy Portability

Strategy portability is a versioned contract. The strategy class can stay the same when it uses
only the shared lifecycle, information, intent, and broker boundaries. The engine and infrastructure
still change.

### Portable Strategy Logic

```python
from ml4t.backtest import Strategy
from ml4t.backtest.types import OrderSide

class BuyOnceStrategy(Strategy):
    def on_data(self, timestamp, data, context, broker):
        bar = data.get("SPY")
        if bar is None:
            return

        if broker.get_position("SPY") is None:
            broker.submit_order("SPY", 10, side=OrderSide.BUY)
```

### Backtest Run

```python
from ml4t.backtest import DataFeed, Engine

feed = DataFeed(prices_df=prices)
engine = Engine(feed=feed, strategy=BuyOnceStrategy())
result = engine.run()
```

### Live Run

```python
from ml4t.live import AlpacaBroker, AlpacaDataFeed, LiveEngine, LiveRiskConfig, SafeBroker

raw_broker = AlpacaBroker(api_key="...", secret_key="...", paper=True)
safe_broker = SafeBroker(raw_broker, LiveRiskConfig(execution_mode="shadow"))
feed = AlpacaDataFeed(
    api_key="...",
    secret_key="...",
    symbols=["SPY"],
    data_type="bars",
    experimental=True,
)

engine = LiveEngine(BuyOnceStrategy(), safe_broker, feed)
await engine.connect()
await engine.run()
```

Backtest and live are different systems. A portable strategy uses the same versioned callback and
canonical-intent contract in both. Outcome comparisons must still account for market data,
execution policy, venue capabilities, safety decisions, latency, and account state.

## Staged Rollout

`ml4t-live` is designed for staged deployment, not instant promotion from notebook to production.

### 1. Start In Shadow Mode

The strategy runs, risk checks run, and `VirtualPortfolio` tracks fills, but no real order is sent.

```python
safe_broker = SafeBroker(
    raw_broker,
    LiveRiskConfig(
        execution_mode="shadow",
        max_position_value=25_000,
        max_order_value=5_000,
        max_orders_per_minute=5,
    ),
)
```

### 2. Graduate To Paper Trading

The key config change is turning shadow mode off while still using paper broker credentials.

```python
safe_broker = SafeBroker(
    raw_broker,
    LiveRiskConfig(
        execution_mode="paper",
        max_position_value=25_000,
        max_order_value=5_000,
        max_orders_per_minute=5,
    ),
)
```

### 3. Go To Small Live Size

Keep limits tight enough that mistakes are survivable.

```python
safe_broker = SafeBroker(
    raw_broker,
    LiveRiskConfig(
        execution_mode="live",
        max_position_value=10_000,
        max_total_exposure=25_000,
        max_order_value=2_500,
        max_drawdown_pct=0.03,
        max_daily_loss=1_000,
    ),
)
```

### 4. Scale Only After Stable Monitoring

Promotion to larger live size should follow routine reconciliation, order-flow review, and operational
checks, not just a passing backtest.

## SafeBroker In Action

The safety model matters because this is a live trading library. `SafeBroker` is the main trust signal,
so it should be understood in concrete terms:

- Set `max_order_shares=100` and `max_order_value=5_000`. `SafeBroker` rejects any single order that
  would exceed 100 shares or $5,000 notional.
- Set `max_position_value=25_000` and `max_total_exposure=50_000`. `SafeBroker` blocks orders that
  would push one position or the overall book beyond those limits.
- Set `max_orders_per_minute=5`. A runaway loop that tries to fire ten orders in a burst gets stopped at
  the broker wrapper.
- Set `allowed_assets={"SPY", "QQQ"}`. Any attempt to trade an asset outside that set raises
  `RiskLimitError`.
- Set `max_drawdown_pct=0.05`. If portfolio equity drops 5% from the high-water mark, the kill switch
  activates and new orders are refused until you clear it.
- Leave `execution_mode="shadow"` selected during the first rollout phase. Orders are recorded and reflected in the
  virtual portfolio, but the real broker never sees them.

### Example Configuration

```python
from ml4t.live import LiveRiskConfig

config = LiveRiskConfig(
    max_position_value=25_000,
    max_position_shares=1_000,
    max_total_exposure=50_000,
    max_positions=10,
    max_order_value=5_000,
    max_order_shares=100,
    max_orders_per_minute=5,
    max_daily_loss=2_000,
    max_drawdown_pct=0.05,
    dedup_window_seconds=1.0,
    allowed_assets={"SPY", "QQQ"},
    execution_mode="shadow",
)
```

### What A Breach Looks Like

```python
from ml4t.live import RiskLimitError

try:
    await safe_broker.submit_order_async("SPY", 1_000)
except RiskLimitError as exc:
    print(f"order blocked: {exc}")
```

That failure mode is intentional. In live trading, "do nothing" is often the correct behavior when the
request is unsafe.

## Broker Comparison

| Broker | Asset Classes | Paper Trading | Live Trading | Best fit |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Alpaca** | US equities, ETFs, Alpaca-supported crypto | Yes | Yes | fast setup, developer-friendly paper workflow |
| **Interactive Brokers** | global equities, options, futures, multi-asset brokerage accounts | Yes | Yes | broader asset coverage and existing IBKR setups |

See [Brokers](user-guide/brokers.md) for connection details and usage patterns.

## Data Feed Comparison

| Data Feed | Status | Source | Market Shape | Best for |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **AlpacaDataFeed** | experimental opt-in | Alpaca API | bars, quotes, trades | custom evaluation only |
| **IBDataFeed** | experimental opt-in | TWS / IB Gateway | real-time ticks | custom evaluation only |
| **OKXFundingFeed** | stable-supported | OKX public APIs | OHLCV plus funding context | perpetual futures and funding-rate strategies |
| **DataBentoFeed** | experimental opt-in | DataBento API or DBN replay | selected tick and bar schemas | custom evaluation only |
| **CryptoFeed** | experimental opt-in | asynchronous CCXT | trades and candles | custom evaluation only |

Use [Data Feeds](user-guide/feeds.md) for examples and feed-specific setup.

## Operator Surfaces

The library now includes a small CLI and a set of bounded operator-focused examples.
Use [CLI](user-guide/cli.md) for `status` and `shadow`, [Examples](user-guide/examples.md) for runnable scripts, and [Operator Guide](user-guide/operator-guide.md) for the recommended promotion workflow.

## Installation

```bash
uv add ml4t-live
```

Or:

```bash
pip install ml4t-live
```

Install `ml4t-live[experimental]` if you deliberately opt in to experimental `DataBentoFeed` use.

## From Book To Deployment

The book develops strategies through research, diagnostics, and backtesting. `ml4t-live` runs a
lifecycle-compatible strategy surface against real brokers with explicit deployment controls.

If you are reading *Machine Learning for Trading, Third Edition*, the practical sequence is:

1. develop and validate the strategy in the book workflow
2. map the notebook to reusable APIs in the [Book Guide](book-guide/index.md)
3. port the strategy into `LiveEngine`
4. start in shadow mode under `SafeBroker`
5. promote only after paper-trading and operational checks pass

## Part Of The ML4T Library Suite

```text
ml4t-data -> ml4t-engineer -> ml4t-diagnostic -> ml4t-backtest -> ml4t-live
```

A lifecycle-v1 `Strategy` class is the portable handoff between `ml4t-backtest` and `ml4t-live`.

## Disclaimer

This library reduces operational risk but does not remove it. Start in shadow mode, validate order
flow and reconciliation carefully, and treat live deployment as a staged process rather than a single
switch from backtest to production.
