# Operator Guide

`ml4t-live` is designed for staged rollout. The practical workflow is:

1. shadow mode with bounded runs
2. paper trading with conservative limits
3. small live size with reconciliation and status checks before promotion

## Preflight

Before you route anything real:

- run `uv run ml4t-live preflight ib --state-file .ml4t_risk_state.json --strict`
- confirm preflight exits successfully before you promote a paper or live session
- confirm the persisted risk state does not show an unexpected active kill switch
- check that startup reconciliation is clean, or intentionally explain every mismatch before proceeding
- verify the journal path is where you expect runtime events to land for this session

If you only want a descriptive dump and not a pass/fail check, use `status` instead.

## Shadow Phase

Shadow mode is the correct first deployment step because it exercises the live engine and strategy path without routing a real order.

```bash
uv run ml4t-live shadow examples/okx_shadow_strategy.py --feed okx --duration 60
```

What to watch during the run:

- `health=ok` when data is flowing normally
- `health=feed_silent` when the feed is running but no fresh data has arrived within the configured silence window
- `health=idle_market_closed` for US equity feeds outside regular market hours
- `recent_intents` to confirm the strategy is attempting the trades you expect
- `positions` to confirm `VirtualPortfolio` state changes line up with those intents

For the public OKX feed, the shadow CLI uses a looser default silence threshold than streaming feeds. Public REST-polled minute bars can arrive unevenly even when the feed is healthy, so `feed_silent` on OKX should be interpreted relative to that wider threshold unless you override it explicitly.

## Paper Phase

Move to paper trading only after the shadow run looks operationally boring.

That means:

- no unexpected kill-switch activations
- no stale-data rejections unless they are explained by the feed
- no reconciliation surprises on restart
- no uncontrolled order bursts

A paper deployment should still keep tight limits:

```python
LiveRiskConfig(
    execution_mode="paper",
    max_position_value=5_000,
    max_order_value=1_000,
    max_daily_loss=500,
    max_data_staleness_seconds=60,
)
```

If you are running US equities and want preflight to fail outside the regular session window, add `--require-market-open` to the CLI check.

## Reconciliation On Startup

`SafeBroker.connect()` now compares the persisted snapshot from the previous run against the broker's live positions and pending orders.

If the report is clean, the persisted and live snapshots match.

If the report shows missing or unexpected positions/orders, stop and investigate before promoting the session. A mismatch usually means one of these happened:

- a previous run exited uncleanly
- manual broker activity occurred outside `ml4t-live`
- fills or cancellations landed after the last persisted snapshot

If you want the library to fail closed instead of only logging the mismatch, set `fail_on_reconciliation_mismatch=True` in `LiveRiskConfig`.

Use the credential-free example when you want to inspect the shape of the report:

```bash
uv run python examples/startup_reconciliation_demo.py
```

## Live Promotion

Promote only the strategy, broker adapter, risk policy, and monitoring path already qualified in
paper trading. Begin with lower notional and preserve every safety control:

- run `preflight --strict` before the session starts
- use `status` for the human-readable snapshot and recent journal tail
- check the startup reconciliation report
- start with smaller notional than you think you need
- only scale after repeated clean starts, stable data, and expected fills

## Runtime Health Meanings

The runtime status values are intentionally narrow:

- `ok`: engine running, broker reachable when known, and bars arriving within the silence threshold
- `waiting_for_data`: engine running but no bar has been seen yet
- `feed_silent`: engine running, market session appears open or continuous, but the feed has gone quiet too long
- `idle_market_closed`: no fresh equity data is expected because the market session is closed
- `broker_disconnected`: engine running but the broker connection is known to be down
- `ready`: broker reconciliation and feed startup completed; the strategy has not started
- `failed`: startup, recovery, callback finalization, or resource cleanup failed
- `stopped`: engine is not running

`runtime_state` reports the transactional phase separately: `preflight`, `connecting_broker`,
`reconciling`, `starting_feed`, `ready`, `starting_strategy`, `running`, `degraded`, `recovering`,
`stopping`, `stopped`, or `failed`. A failed broker or feed acquisition is released in reverse
order. If `on_start` is attempted, `on_end` is attempted exactly once, including startup failure
and cancellation paths.

These states do not replace external process monitoring or deployment supervision.

## Failure Boundaries

Startup rollback releases each acquired resource in reverse order. If broker connection succeeds
and feed startup fails, the engine stops the attempted feed and disconnects the broker before it
returns the error. A strategy startup error also runs finalization once and releases both resources.

A recovery gap, conflicting replay, older sequence, or event-time reversal raises
`FeedContinuityError` before another strategy callback. Queue overload raises `FeedOverflowError`,
discards pending work, and records the rejected event and queue state. Neither condition permits
silent data loss or automatic continuation.

Engine failures retain their original exception type and traceback. Pass the exception to
`runtime_error_context(error)` to obtain a `RuntimeErrorContext` with `component`, `operation`, the
pre-cleanup `runtime_state`, `recovery_action`, and `root_cause_type`. The same values are safe to
serialize with `to_dict()`. Exception messages and runtime diagnostic payloads redact credential
and account identifiers before they cross the public runtime boundary.

An audit failure blocks the broker call when `fail_on_journal_error=True`. An accepted order that
cannot be persisted raises `AcceptedOrderPersistenceError` and requires reconciliation instead of
automatic retry. A cleanup failure raises `RuntimeCleanupError` and leaves the runtime failed until
the operator corrects the provider error and retries cleanup.

## Execution Journal

`SafeBroker` now writes a JSONL execution journal next to the risk-state file by default. It records:

- submitted or shadow-filled orders
- kill-switch activations
- startup reconciliation outcomes
- engine health transitions
- watchdog recovery attempts and results

Use `status` when you want a short journal tail, and inspect the JSONL file directly when you need a deeper operator trail.

`status` validates state permissions, schema, integrity, and the journal hash chain before showing
the tail. A persistence error returns a nonzero status and leaves the failing file unchanged. Treat
`AcceptedOrderPersistenceError` as an order that may not be retried: reconcile venue orders and
positions first. On POSIX systems, state and audit files, including `.lock` and `.head` sidecars,
must remain owned by the service user with mode `0600`. On Windows, use a directory whose ACL grants
access only to the service account and required administrators.

## Optional Watchdog Recovery

If you want the engine to attempt bounded recovery instead of only reporting degraded health, configure it in Python:

```python
engine = LiveEngine(
    strategy,
    safe_broker,
    feed,
    feed_silence_seconds=60,
    auto_recover=True,
    recovery_cooldown_seconds=5,
    max_recovery_attempts=3,
)
```

Recovery releases the feed and broker before each bounded reconnect attempt. It does not repeat
`on_start` or `on_prepare`, and it retains strategy intent and rule state in the existing runtime.
The engine also retains the last accepted market-event identity. It skips exact replays, but an
explicit gap, older sequence, backwards timestamp, conflicting completed event, or new event
without continuity evidence after reconnect raises `FeedContinuityError` before another strategy
callback. Queue overflow raises `FeedOverflowError` with gap and queue evidence. Both conditions
record `feed_safety_halt` and require operator reconciliation.
`operational_events` retains the most recent 4,096 runtime diagnostics, including recovery reason,
attempt, duration, last processed event count, cleanup result, and terminal state. Callback and
operational totals remain available under `engine.stats["diagnostics"]`, together with retained and
pruned counts. High-frequency successful callback boundaries are counted and retained in this
bounded memory view but are not written to the execution journal. Callback failures, health
changes, recovery, reconciliation, and order events remain journaled. Exhausted recovery raises
`RuntimeFailureError` and leaves `runtime_state=failed`. A resource release failure raises
`RuntimeCleanupError`; call `stop()` again after correcting a transient provider failure to retry
release.

## Book example

The [runtime safety notebook](https://github.com/stefan-jansen/machine-learning-for-trading/blob/d2edec54b1c7a6a9d7a97d8129eb05db4491e1eb/25_live_trading/13_runtime_safety_showcase.ipynb)
calls Live to show kill-switch persistence, startup reconciliation, and engine health. The
[safe rollout notebook](https://github.com/stefan-jansen/machine-learning-for-trading/blob/d2edec54b1c7a6a9d7a97d8129eb05db4491e1eb/26_mlops_governance/03_safe_model_rollout.ipynb)
teaches promotion decisions manually and does not call Live.

## Verify restart reporting locally

Run `uv run python examples/startup_reconciliation_demo.py`. The synthetic persisted snapshot and
broker snapshot deliberately differ; the report prints `"clean": false` and lists missing and
unexpected positions and pending orders. This checks mismatch reporting without connecting a
provider. On a real account, treat any mismatch as a stop point and reconcile before sending a new
order. See the [API reference](../api/index.md#safety-and-rollout) for `SafeBroker`.
