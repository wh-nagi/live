# Risk Controls

`SafeBroker` is the pre-trade control layer around a live broker. It validates each order before submission, persists risk state across restarts, and keeps the kill switch sticky until you clear it.

## Why Risk Controls Live Outside The Strategy

Backtests often treat risk policy as part of simulation assumptions. Live deployment needs those
controls to be explicit, restart-safe, and broker-adjacent. `SafeBroker` is the layer that enforces
that policy consistently regardless of strategy code.

## What Is Enforced Today

At order submission time, `SafeBroker` currently enforces:

- position and exposure caps
- per-order notional and share limits
- order-rate limiting and duplicate-order suppression
- asset allow/block lists
- price-deviation checks for priced orders
- stale-data rejection via `max_data_staleness_seconds`
- daily-loss rejection via `max_daily_loss`
- drawdown-triggered kill-switch activation via `max_drawdown_pct`
- shadow-mode execution through `VirtualPortfolio`

The market-price checks now use the latest cached market snapshot from the engine instead of a placeholder fallback for first-entry trades.

## LiveRiskConfig

```python
from ml4t.live import LiveRiskConfig

config = LiveRiskConfig(
    max_position_value=25_000,
    max_position_shares=1_000,
    max_total_exposure=100_000,
    max_positions=10,
    max_order_value=5_000,
    max_order_shares=250,
    max_orders_per_minute=5,
    max_daily_loss=2_000,
    max_drawdown_pct=0.10,
    max_price_deviation_pct=0.05,
    max_data_staleness_seconds=60,
    dedup_window_seconds=1.0,
    allowed_assets={"SPY", "QQQ"},
    blocked_assets={"GME"},
    execution_mode="shadow",
    kill_switch_enabled=False,
    fail_on_reconciliation_mismatch=True,
    state_file=".ml4t_risk_state.json",
    journal_file=".ml4t_execution_journal.jsonl",
)
```

Set an individual numeric limit to `None` to disable only that check. Numeric limits reject NaN and
infinity. Position and order share limits accept positive fractional values; position counts and
orders-per-minute remain positive integers.

## Control Groups

### Position Limits

- `max_position_value`
- `max_position_shares`
- `max_total_exposure`
- `max_positions`

### Order Limits

- `max_order_value`
- `max_order_shares`
- `max_orders_per_minute`
- `dedup_window_seconds`

### Loss And Safety Limits

- `max_daily_loss`
- `max_drawdown_pct`
- `max_price_deviation_pct`
- `max_data_staleness_seconds`
- `allowed_assets`
- `blocked_assets`

### Execution And Persistence

- `execution_mode`: required `"shadow"`, `"paper"`, or `"live"` destination
- `kill_switch_enabled`
- `fail_on_reconciliation_mismatch`
- `state_file`
- `journal_file`
- `fail_on_journal_error`

## Persisted State

The risk state file persists more than just the kill switch. It now captures:

- current trading date and daily counters
- daily-loss baseline through `session_start_equity`
- persisted position and pending-order snapshots from the last clean disconnect
- unresolved cancel-and-resubmit replacement gaps
- kill-switch state and reason

That persisted snapshot is used again on the next `SafeBroker.connect()` to generate the startup reconciliation report.
If `fail_on_reconciliation_mismatch=True`, a non-clean reconciliation raises `ReconciliationMismatchError` and blocks startup outside shadow mode.

State is stored in a versioned envelope with a generation number and SHA-256 integrity check. On
POSIX systems, state, journal, integrity-head, and lock files are created and replaced with mode
`0600`; current-user ownership and exact mode are validated when files are opened. All platforms
reject file links and linked parent paths, invalid field types, integrity failures, and unsupported
schemas. One `SafeBroker` owns an exclusive writer lease until disconnect or
`close_persistence()`. On Windows, configure the persistence directory with an ACL that grants
access only to the service account and required administrators.

## Execution Journal

`SafeBroker` also writes a JSONL execution journal. By default it lives next to the risk-state file and includes:

- order submissions and shadow fills
- manual or automatic kill-switch events
- startup reconciliation outcomes
- engine health transitions and recovery attempts when the broker is used through `LiveEngine`

Each journal record includes its sequence, predecessor hash, and record hash. A separate atomic
head file detects removal of complete trailing records. The default `fail_on_journal_error=True`
writes an order-intent record before a broker call and blocks the call if that write fails. Set it
to `False` only when a documented deployment policy permits trading without an audit record;
`safe_broker.persistence_status` reports the active policy and any failure.

Set `journal_file` explicitly when you want the journal stored elsewhere. It must not overlap the
state path or state lock.

## Migration And Recovery

A structurally valid legacy state file is converted to the versioned envelope when `SafeBroker` is
first constructed. Before migration, the legacy file must already be a regular file. On POSIX
systems it must also be owned by the current user with mode `0600`; on Windows its directory must
have the restricted ACL described above.

Corrupt, truncated, tampered, unsafe, and unsupported files are never replaced during startup.
Keep the original file as diagnostic evidence and restore a known-good backup to a new path. An
existing unchained journal is not rewritten in place; archive it and configure a new journal path.
Do not retry an order after `AcceptedOrderPersistenceError`: the venue or shadow portfolio already
accepted it, and operator reconciliation must determine its state.

## Shadow Mode

Shadow mode is the recommended first deployment step:

```python
safe_broker = SafeBroker(broker, LiveRiskConfig(execution_mode="shadow"))
```

In shadow mode:

- all normal risk checks still run
- orders are marked filled virtually
- `VirtualPortfolio` tracks positions and cash locally
- no real broker order is submitted

## Kill Switch

The kill switch can be activated manually or by a loss breach:

```python
safe_broker.enable_kill_switch("manual halt")
safe_broker.disable_kill_switch()
```

Kill-switch state is persisted in `state_file`, so it survives process restarts until it is manually cleared.

## SafeBroker Usage

```python
from ml4t.live import IBBroker, LiveRiskConfig, SafeBroker

raw_broker = IBBroker(port=7497)
safe_broker = SafeBroker(
    raw_broker,
    LiveRiskConfig(
        execution_mode="shadow",
        max_position_value=10_000,
        max_order_value=2_500,
        max_daily_loss=500,
        max_data_staleness_seconds=60,
    ),
)
```

Inside `Strategy.on_data(...)`, order placement stays synchronous because `LiveEngine` passes a thread-safe broker wrapper to the strategy:

```python
def on_data(self, timestamp, data, context, broker):
    if broker.get_position("AAPL") is None:
        broker.submit_order("AAPL", 10)

    # Pending orders can also be updated through the sync wrapper.
    # broker.replace_order("ML4T-1", limit_price=189.5)
```

## Errors

Risk violations raise `RiskLimitError`:

```python
from ml4t.live import RiskLimitError

try:
    await safe_broker.submit_order_async("AAPL", 10_000)
except RiskLimitError as exc:
    print(f"blocked: {exc}")
```

## Recommended Progression

1. Start in shadow mode.
2. Validate order flow, virtual positions, and runtime health.
3. Move to paper credentials with conservative limits.
4. Check `ml4t-live status` and startup reconciliation before going live.
5. Increase size only after repeated clean starts and expected fills.

calls `SafeBroker` to show shadow limits. The
[runtime safety notebook](https://github.com/stefan-jansen/machine-learning-for-trading/blob/d2edec54b1c7a6a9d7a97d8129eb05db4491e1eb/25_live_trading/13_runtime_safety_showcase.ipynb)
calls Live to show persistence and restart reconciliation. The
[circuit-breaker notebook](https://github.com/stefan-jansen/machine-learning-for-trading/blob/d2edec54b1c7a6a9d7a97d8129eb05db4491e1eb/26_mlops_governance/04_circuit_breakers.ipynb)
teaches broader controls manually; it does not call Live.

## Verify the controls locally

Run `uv run python examples/risk_guard_demo.py`. The script submits one order with fresh synthetic
data, rejects a stale-data order, and activates the daily-loss kill switch without reaching a
provider. Confirm the output includes `fresh_data_order: accepted`, `stale_data_block:`, and
`kill_switch_active: True`. This checks the control path, not broker execution. See
[`LiveRiskConfig` and `SafeBroker`](../api/index.md#safety-and-rollout) for exact options.
