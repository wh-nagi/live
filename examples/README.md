# Examples

`shadow_mode_demo.py`, `startup_reconciliation_demo.py`, and `risk_guard_demo.py` are the
credential-free deterministic set. Release qualification copies all three outside the source tree
and runs them against the installed wheel. The other examples require an external service or paper
credentials and never run in an untrusted pull-request context.

`shadow_mode_demo.py` is the fastest path from install to a working run. It uses a synthetic feed
plus `SafeBroker(execution_mode="shadow")` and `VirtualPortfolio`, needs no credentials or broker
session, prints progress every five seconds, and exits after about a minute.

`startup_reconciliation_demo.py` shows the startup reconciliation path without any live infrastructure. It writes a persisted state snapshot that disagrees with the broker's live positions and orders, connects through `SafeBroker`, and prints the reconciliation report.

`risk_guard_demo.py` demonstrates two runtime guards without a real broker: stale-data rejection and daily-loss kill-switch activation. It accepts one fresh-data shadow order, blocks one stale-data order, then shows the kill switch activating after a simulated equity drop.

`okx_shadow_strategy.py` is a strategy module for `ml4t-live shadow`. It prints completed OKX bars without submitting orders. The CLI uses its `SYMBOLS` list and needs outbound HTTPS but no credentials.

`okx_funding_paper.py` uses the public OKX REST API to poll BTC, ETH, and SOL perpetual swaps on 1-minute candles. It needs only outbound HTTPS access to `okx.com`, prints funding snapshots and simple long/short bias labels, and exits after about 70 seconds.

`alpaca_paper_equity.py` connects to Alpaca paper trading for SPY, QQQ, and IWM with a tiny moving-average crossover strategy. It requires `ALPACA_API_KEY` and `ALPACA_SECRET_KEY`, uses paper-only endpoints, prints heartbeats every five seconds, and exits after about 95 seconds.

`ib_paper_equity.py` connects to TWS or IB Gateway on `127.0.0.1:7497` and runs a toy momentum strategy on a few large-cap equities. It requires a local IB paper session with API access and market-data subscriptions, prints heartbeats every five seconds, and exits after about 75 seconds.

`live_ib_example.py` connects only to the configured IB paper session and combines the experimental
IB tick feed with stable bar aggregation. It routes strategy orders to the shadow portfolio, runs
for 90 seconds by default, and closes all resources. Set `ML4T_EXAMPLE_DURATION_SECONDS` to change
the bound. Connection, authentication, account-identity, and market-data failures exit non-zero and
never select a live port automatically.
